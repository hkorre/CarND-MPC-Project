# Refelction

Much of my initial code was based on mpc_to_line/solution/MPC.cpp from https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Quizzes.
I'll refer to this as "the MPC-Quiz".

## Model

## Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

* First Variables
My first versions had dt=0.05 and N=25. I started with these numbers because that's what the MPC-Quiz.

## Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing

## Model Predictive Control with Latency
